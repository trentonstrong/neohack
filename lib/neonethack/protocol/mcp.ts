Use named game tools for intents; continue a standing decision with decision_answer or decision_cancel, never by repeating its initiating action. Never auto-confirm warnings or restart interrupted work. Item IDs and choice IDs come from returned candidates; eligibility reveals neither safety nor hidden properties. Gameplay/decision calls need a unique requestId and the latest expectedRevision. After uncertainty, retry only the exact ID and payload. Creation has no retry ID; do not blindly resubmit. Results use structuredContent: outcome, ordered events, perceived observation and at most one decision. Snapshot replaces state; delta replaces supplied fields and upserts world cells by x,y. update.remove deletes fields; update.worldRemoved deletes cells. update.knowledgeObservedTurn replaces only knowledge.observedTurn in the existing knowledge block. Apply a delta only when update.base equals your last update.id; otherwise call session_observe for a full snapshot. session_actions supplies local action offers. Cached receipts may be historical; observe for current state.";
